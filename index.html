        <h1>Fast cryptographic networking for Haskell</h1>

    <p><a title="Networking and Cryptography library" href="http://nacl.cace-project.eu/">NaCl</a> (pronounced "salt") is a safe, high-speed, easy to use cryptographic library by none other than <a href="http://cr.yp.to/">djb</a>; the project was initiated by <a title="Computer Aided Cryptography Engineering" href="http://cace-project.eu/">CACE</a>. From their own homepage:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote">
	<p>NaCl (pronounced "salt") is a new easy-to-use high-speed software 
library for network communication, encryption, decryption, signatures, 
etc. NaCl's goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to 
build higher-level cryptographic tools.</p>

	<p>Of course, other libraries already exist for these core operations. 
NaCl advances the state of the art by improving security, by improving 
usability, and by improving speed.</p>
      </blockquote>

<p>This package aims to provide a complete, type-safe, and efficient Haskell binding that's just as easy to use.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://nacl.cace-project.eu/features.html" title="NaCl features">features</a> page to learn more about the design.</p>

<p>Want to learn how NaCl <em>really</em> stacks up to the crypto-competition? Check out the authors' paper, <a href="http://cr.yp.to/highspeed/coolnacl-20111201.pdf">"The security impact of a new cryptographic library"</a> (PDF.)</p>

<p>In the future, there are plans to provide a complete <a href="http://curvecp.org/" title="CurveCP">CurveCP</a>
 implementation as well, built on top of this basic work. It's also 
eventually planned to include the NaCl reference source code with the 
package itself, for easier distribution and testing, but at the moment 
you must build the optimized library (see 'Install' below.)</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>Unix-ish OSs only (that's all NaCl supports.)</p>

<p>Currently tested on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GHC versions 7.0.4 to 7.4.1-RC1 and regular HEAD snapshots.</li>
  <li>Linux and Mac OS X (Snow Leopard.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Almost all the code is Haskell-2010 compliant, and should be 
relatively portable. There are no direct dependencies outside of the 
libraries that ship with GHC.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>
<p>Just build in one step with <code>cabal install</code>!</p>
<pre>
    $ cabal update &amp;&amp; cabal install salt
</pre>

<p>This will build the source code for NaCl - included in the source - and
install it under a directory under <code>$HOME/.haskell.salt</code>. This process
will take quite a while the first time, and will only be necessary when the
underlying NaCl version changes. <strong>Don't remove this directory!</strong>
</p>

<p>This step is needed because NaCl has a build process that benchmarks many
implementations of itself and selects the fastest primitives. Many optimized
implementations are raw machine-generated assembly code.</p>

<p>Currently, you must build by linking against the optimized versions 
of the various encryption routines. The slower, reference versions of 
the encryption routines written in C are not available for usage at this
 time. Future work will hopefully alleviate this issue, making the 
library more portable for some, at the expense of a lot of speed.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Dynamic linking (GHC's <code>-dynamic</code>) is currently 
unsupported at the moment, as the CPU-optimized NaCl assembly code is 
provided in a non-relocatable form, and thus totally unsuitable for 
shared libraries. There is nothing I can do about this that will still 
preserve the high-speed CPU-optimized versions, short of hacking on NaCl
 itself. This will be possible to support using the slower, reference 
implementations written in C, however.</p>
